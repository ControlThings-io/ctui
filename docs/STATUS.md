# Project status

Last reconciled: 2026-09-21, `main` at `cd848e7`; working tree was clean before
the current path-completion work. Remote refs and live CI were not refreshed.

## Current state

- Package metadata and lockfile remain `1.0.0rc1`. The owner confirmed RC1
  publication and basic functionality on September 18. RC2 is next; stable 1.0
  still requires additional changes and acceptance testing (decision D10).
- Since RC1: OS classifiers, hierarchical help/dialog scrolling, completion,
  documentation, error containment, and protocol argument types were improved.
  Latest committed change: dialog redraw fix in `cd848e7`, confirmed working
  by the owner.
- Mixed byte input requires explicit `0x`/`0b`/`0o`/`0d` prefixes; fuzzy patterns
  support bounded mixed-radix byte choices. See [types.py](../src/ctui/types.py)
  and the latest entries in [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md).

## Current work

- Added public, opt-in `PathCompleter` with threaded directory listing, directory
  navigation, home expansion, file filters, and directory-only mode.
- Applied it to project/config import and export, history export, and the
  filesystem example; new export names remain valid without a suggestion.
- Completion insertion now replaces raw quoted/escaped token spans and quotes
  selected values for parsing, including inline named options.
- Updated public API documentation and regressions. Changes remain uncommitted.

## Validation evidence

- All 135 tests passed on Python 3.11. Full Black/isort, lockfile, and
  whitespace checks passed. New regressions cover provider filtering, filesystem
  errors, relative/home paths, quoted insertion, and built-in wiring.
- Owner confirmed the preceding dialog fix works. No new remote CI or artifact
  checks claimed; repeat release checks for RC2.

## Next steps: RC2

- Manually check help scrolling and focus restoration in real terminals,
  including narrow windows and application-specific shortcuts.
- Capture further owner-requested RC2 changes and acceptance tests. Record
  platform, Python version, package/revision, and results for acceptance runs.
- Reconcile release documentation: CHANGELOG currently labels `[1.0.0]` stable
  while metadata remains RC1. Confirm intended labels/date and readiness
  classifier; RC note fallback alone is not a workflow failure.
- Prepare `1.0.0rc2` after remaining changes/testing, including post-RC1 fixes.
  Follow [RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md](../RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md) for that revision,
  including full source/artifact checks, remote CI, matching tag, publication,
  and release/attestation links. Do not reuse RC1 validation as RC2 evidence.
- Resolve D07's outstanding `history clear` versus `project reset history`
  discrepancy with the owner before changing that behavior.

## Optional follow-ups, not release commitments

- Background-job service and `py.typed` remain explicitly optional (D10).
- Assess existing tests before adding cancellation/database, large-transfer,
  or repeated-lifecycle stress coverage; reduce duplicate CI runs if warranted.
- Previously documented limits: example 13's custom root lacks modal float
  support; theme palettes are identical; dialogs have a horizontal-scrollbar
  TODO. Cancellation cleanup was subsequently fixed in `be050b8`.

## Handoff

No implementation blocker identified. Remaining validation is listed above.
Repository notes transfer with the branch only after explicitly authorized
commit/push, followed by a pull on the receiving laptop. Copy the global
`~/.codex/AGENTS.md` separately; it is not tracked by this repository.
